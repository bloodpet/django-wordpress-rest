Welcome to django-wordpress-rest's documentation!
=================================================


Django-wordpress-rest is a Django application that syncs content from a WordPress.com site to a Django site.
This is done using the `WordPress.com REST API <https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/>`_.
A separate copy of the content data is stored on the Django side, which allows for loose coupling and extensability.
